# Object Detection Using YOLOv8  

This project delivers a **comprehensive solution** for **license plate detection** using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection model. From dataset preparation and model training to developing a robust Flask API, this repository is your one-stop guide to implementing real-time license plate detection.

## üöÄ **Project Highlights**  

- **Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB):** Handles rotated license plates with precision.  
- **Flask API Integration:** Provides an easy-to-use web interface for detection.  
- **GPU-Accelerated Training:** Powered by Kaggle for efficient model training.  
- **Visualization-Ready:** Clear and insightful results showcased in a Jupyter Notebook.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Features**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Dataset Preparation**  
- Dataset sourced from **Roboflow** with high-quality annotations.  
- Preprocessing steps include scaling, augmentations, and proper formatting for YOLOv8.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **YOLOv8 Training**  
- Trained on a Kaggle **GPU environment** for optimal performance.  
- Model trained for **10 epochs** (for better prediction we can train for more epochs).
- The best model weights (`best.pt`) are ready for deployment.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Flask API**  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Upload images via the web interface for detection.  
- **AI-Powered Backend:** Returns:  
  - Images with annotated bounding boxes.  
  - JSON files with bounding box coordinates and class labels.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Inference and Visualization**  
- Intuitive visualization of results through bounding boxes and JSON outputs.  
- Detection results include bounding box **coordinates**, **angles**, and class **labels**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Project Workflow**  

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - Downloaded and preprocessed the dataset from **Roboflow**.  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Trained the YOLOv8 model in a Kaggle GPU environment.  
   - Saved the trained model weights as `best.pt`.  

3. **Inference**  
   - Performed inference using the trained model on test images.  
   - Saved results as annotated images and bounding box coordinates and rotated angle details.  

4. **Flask API**  
   - Built APIs to handle image uploads and run the YOLOv8 model for real-time inference.
